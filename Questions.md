# In a single paragraph, briefly describe your project. What is its subject matter and extent? What makes it historically important? Why are you interested in it?

This projects endeavours to undertake an curriculum history of First Nations representations and depictions in Ontario public and secondary school curriculum. As Canadians discover the depth and intensity of the reality of state crimes against Indigenous populations, it is critical to understand and interrogate what role public education plays in hiding, distorting, and erasing the historical reality. Several important questions can be formulated to support this project, including: What is the result of this on the Canadian public? On the indigenous lives? On the trajectory of understanding?

# What makes the card format useful for this topic? What limits do the cards present and how might you expand your project to get around those limits?

The card format will be useful in organizing and accessing material chronologically, which is the trajectory of this project. Cards used as menu items can link to blog articles, essays, data, images, etc. 


# What data fields does each card need in your project? Why? How might you store this data?

I envion date fields for:<br>
* Time period (I.e.1960 â€” 1970)
* Province/Territory
* Classification or taxonomy (to be determined as research is completed)
* Grade level
* Public or Separate School Board
* Government 
* Subject area 
* Materials
* Literature or media
* Classification of material or content covered in curriculum (Anthropological, cultural, religious, history, etc.)

# Explain the changes you made to the HTML structure and the CSS rules for this project. Why did you make these changes and how happy are you with the result? 

I attempted to add a secondary headline (h4) to the main banner. While it does appear and I was able to format the CSS, the position is incorrect. I would like to learn how to correc this. The secondary headline (h4)is important for identifying what this project is about. Ideally, I would add another line of text with the course name and code, in a smaller text size.
